.. code-block:: python

    from pybuoy import Buoy

    buoy = Buoy()


With the ``buoy`` instance you can then interact with NDBC:

- `Get realtime meteorological data <https://pybuoy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/realtime_data.html#get-meteorological-data>`_ for buoy by station_id.

- `Get realtime wave summary data <https://pybuoy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/realtime_data.html#get-wave-summary-data>`_ for buoy by station_id.
